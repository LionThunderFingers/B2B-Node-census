# B2B Node Census

Hourly census of the **reachable** Bitcoin Knots BLAKE2b network, measured by crawling it from an independent DNS seed (`seed.thelionpool.org`).

Live page: https://lionthunderfingers.github.io/B2B-Node-census/

`data.json` is regenerated hourly by the seed host and pushed here; the page reads it. Figures count only nodes that accept incoming connections, so they are a lower bound on the real network.
